Project - Zephyr
Group - 3
We have attached the class diagram, sequence diagram, package diagram and the code.

Convener_sequence has the convener's sequence diagram.
sequence_diagram has the sequence diagram for rest of the actor's.
In all sequence diagrams the first objects are actors.
The convener_sequence.zargo file has two diagrams -
	1.Representing the collaboration with event and result classes
	2.Representing the collaboration with hostel class.

Class.zargo has the class diagram for our project.
All get-set methods are not included in the class diagram.

The code contains 5 classes and their corresponding test classes.
Since it is redundant so only 1 test method has been made for all get methods of event class.
